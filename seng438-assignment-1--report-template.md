# Introduction

This report contains the results of non-scripted manual testing, scripted manual testing, and regression testing completed on an ATM simulation system created by Gordon College. The defect reports presented in this report are created and documented using Backlog. With pair testing used during the exploratory testing process, the thought process of each pair of Engineers prior to the exploratory testing is presented. The findings in this stage are then compared to manual scripted testing completed on the same system. Finally, these defect reports are peer reviewed and changed based on feedback provided by each pair. Preceding this assignment, the most any Engineers in this group knew about exploratory and manual functioning testing was what was taught during lectures. 

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Going into the Exploratory Testing, as a group we had decided to, at the very least, test every main function present in the system. This would mean testing all options presented, all text boxes, and all inputs that a user may enter. This was escpecially important in this case because we are dealing with an ATM system. Generally, systems that are concerned with dealing with money and sensitive information like credit or debit cards need to be absolutely bug proof. There should be absolutely no way for a user to enter input that would allow for the user to gain access to an account that they do not own or perform transactions that should not be possible. As a result, we wanted to particularly test whether the ATM system would securely allow for a user to use their account and perform transactions that work correctly. This would mean that each pair would test each significant function multiple times with different and unexpected inputs.
